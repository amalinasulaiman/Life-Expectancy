# Life-Expectancy
#### I built my first web app dashboard using shiny and R
1. The dataset for Life Expectancy can be obtained from gapminder and tidytuesday. 
	- The clean dataset can be obtained from my Data Folder.
<br>

2. Two seperate files were created:

- <b>ui.R</b>
    - User Interface: This is what the users will see
- <b>server.R</b>
    - Server Function: This is where the data is processed
<br>

3. The deployed version is available on: https://amalinas.shinyapps.io/Life_Expectancy/
<br>
  
4. The dashboard contains:
	- Life Expectancy vs. Time (per country)
	- Life Expectancy vs. Time (comparison of life expectancy of two countries)
	- Life Expectancy vs Continents (comparison of life expectancy of different continents at a specific year)
	- Life Expectancy vs GDP (Bubble Chart to see the relationship of GDP and Life Expectancy of different countries at a specific year)
